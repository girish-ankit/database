# 1° Row — top

top - 11:37:19 up 1 day, 1:25,   3 users,  load average: 1.05, 0.70, 5.09

This first line indicates in order:

current time (11:37:19)
uptime of the machine (up 1 day, 1:25)
users sessions logged in (3 users)
average load on the system (load average: 1.05, 0.70, 5.09) the 3 values refer to the last minute, five minutes and 15 minutes.

NOTE: Load average what Do the Numbers Mean, Exactly?

>> Let’s use the above numbers to understand what the load average actually means. Assuming you’re using a single-CPU system, the numbers tell us that:
> over the last 1 minute: The computer was overloaded by 5% on average. On average, .05 processes were waiting for the CPU. (1.05)
> over the last 5 minutes: The CPU idled for 30% of the time. (0.70)
> over the last 15 minutes: The computer was overloaded by 409% on average. On average, 4.09 processes were waiting for the CPU. (5.09)

>> You probably have a system with multiple CPUs or a multi-core CPU. The load average numbers work a bit differently on such a system. For example,
if you have a load average of 2 on a single-CPU system, this means your system was overloaded by 100 percent — the entire period of time, one process 
was using the CPU while one other process was waiting. On a system with two CPUs, this would be complete usage — two different processes were using
two different CPUs the entire time. On a system with four CPUs, this would be half usage — two processes were using two CPUs, while two CPUs were sitting idle.

To understand the load average number, you need to know how many CPUs your system has. A load average of 6.03 would indicate a system with a single CPU was
massively overloaded, but it would be fine on a computer with 8 CPUs.
