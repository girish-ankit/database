or this query to list the size of every table in the database, largest first:

round(((data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024), 2) "Size in MB" 
FROM information_schema.TABLES 
WHERE table_schema = "$DB_NAME"
ORDER BY (data_length + index_length) DESC;

// for IOCL database use  $DB_NAME = iocl
$TABLE_NAME = table name
